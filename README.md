Connecting to MotherDuck with ADBC: Examples and Benchmarks

For examples in other languages and with other databases, query engines, and data platforms, see the [ADBC Quickstarts](https://github.com/columnar-tech/adbc-quickstarts). The DuckDB quickstart examples can all be adapted to work with MotherDuck with these steps:
1. Change `games.duckdb` to `md:my_db`.
2. Change the `SELECT` statement to query one of the tables in `my_db` in your MotherDuck workspace.
